# Two-tier lookup:
#   1. PRICING_BY_PROVIDER  — (provider, model_id_lower) → rates. Authoritative
#      when we know which provider served the call (Hermes records this in
#      sessions.billing_provider).
#   2. PRICING (flat)       — model_id_lower → rates. Used when provider is
#      unknown OR provider-keyed lookup misses. Direct-provider prices are
#      treated as canonical.
#
# Same model on different providers can cost very different things. Example:
#   deepseek-v4-pro on DeepSeek direct: $0.66 in / $1.98 out (off-peak)
#   deepseek-v4-pro on Together:        $2.10 in / $4.40 out
#   deepseek-v4-pro on Fireworks:       $1.74 in / $3.48 out
# Don't flatten — keep provider-keyed entries where they conflict.

    # DeepSeek bills two rates by clock time: peak (01:00-04:00 and 06:00-10:00
    # UTC, Mon-Fri) costs exactly 2x off-peak. calculate_cost carries ONE rate
    # per model and takes no timestamp, and a session routinely spans both

    # We bill off-peak because that is the list price the docs lead with; a

# were billed at July's rate, and re-costing an old session at today's rate
# makes a user's spend history silently wrong — which is exactly what correcting
# the DeepSeek tables did before these bands existed (#303).
#
# Each entry is a list of (effective_from, rates) ascending. A band applies from
# its instant until the next band starts; a timestamp older than the first band
# uses the first band. The LAST band must equal the model's entry in the tables
# above — test_pricing_history.py asserts this, so the two can't drift.
#
# Only models whose price actually MOVED belong here. Everything else resolves
# through the normal tables and is unaffected, so this stays small.
#
# Timestamps are UTC. DeepSeek's cutover has a published time (16:00 UTC); the
# OpenAI cuts were announced by date only, so those bands start at 00:00 UTC and
# a session on the cut date itself may be off by up to a day. Recorded here
# rather than hidden, because it is the one imprecise thing in this table.

    ``cache_creation_tokens`` are prompt-cache WRITE tokens (Anthropic's
    ``cache_creation_input_tokens``). Anthropic bills these at 1.25x the input
    rate — distinct from ``cached_tokens`` (cache READ), billed at the much
    cheaper ``cached_read`` rate. Defaults to 0 so existing positional callers
    are unaffected.

    ``at`` is when the tokens were generated (datetime or ISO string). Models
    whose price changed on a known date are listed in PRICING_HISTORY; passing
    ``at`` prices those at the rate in force THEN rather than now, so correcting
    a table doesn't silently rewrite a user's spend history. Omitting it keeps
    the previous behaviour exactly: current rates for everything.

    ``endpoint`` and ``tok_per_sec`` are optional and only affect the
    local/subscription branches: if the session was served by a flat-subscription
    endpoint the per-call cost is 0 (billed monthly), and a local model with no
    API rate is priced by its electricity draw. All callers that omit these get
    the unchanged per-token behaviour.
