"""Tests for the menu-bar card geometry, width and labelling.

A menu item must report its height BEFORE the menu opens, so the sizing here is
pure arithmetic with no AppKit dependency, and an error shows up as a clipped
card rather than an exception. Covers:
  - a window is TWO lines, which is what keeps a six-provider menu on screen
  - card_height accounts for header, rows and gaps
  - layout_rows offsets never overlap
  - panel_width scales with the display and stays inside a readable band
  - the drawn fill is derived from the same unicode bar the text menu shows
  - brand tint and monogram fall back rather than raising on an unknown agent
