"""TokenTelemetry product telemetry — anonymous, opt-out, content-free.

Sends a tiny set of feature-usage events so we can learn which parts of the app
people actually use (see docs/design/product-telemetry.md). It is deliberately
boring and safe:

  - **On by default, one-click off.** Preference ``telemetry`` (default True). A
    first-run notice in the UI tells the user it's on and how to turn it off.
    ``DO_NOT_TRACK`` / ``TT_NO_TELEMETRY`` force it off (policy/CI); CI and
    non-interactive launches never emit (no one to inform).
  - **The app never holds any key.** Events POST to a Cloudflare Worker we run
    (``TT_TELEMETRY_URL``); the Worker writes them to Workers Analytics Engine
    via an account-bound binding — there is no credential anywhere in the
    request path, and nothing to extract from the open-source bundle. See proxy/.
  - **Content-free by construction.** ``_sanitize_props`` keeps ONLY an explicit
    per-event allowlist of keys, each value forced through ``_safe_scalar`` and
    (for controlled fields) an enum. Anything else — paths, prompts, project
    names, free text, costs — is dropped, not sent. ``test_telemetry_redaction``
    is the guardrail that keeps this true.
  - **Best-effort.** Every send is fire-and-forget on a daemon thread with a
    short timeout; all failures are swallowed. Telemetry never slows or breaks
    the app — same fail-open posture as the update check.

There is no persistent user identifier. ``sessionId`` is random per process
launch and is not stored or linked across launches.
